			<h1> Has Financial-Aid Been Affected For New Yorker's Going to College Since COVID? </h1>
			<h2> New York's Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) is NY’s largest student financial aid grant program which helps NY residents 
			attending in state higher education institutions. Using state data to compare the pre-pandemic years (2018-2019) with the post-
			pandemic landscape (2022-2023), I analyzed which college sectors—public, private, or for- profit—saw the most significant changes in TAP funding and the number of student recipients. </h2>

			<p>This first graph shows the TAP Recipient Dollars in millions by year starting in 2000 continuing through to 2023. As you can see, there was a downward trend starting at around 2018 with the total for the year being approximately $886 million. The curve took a turn for the worse in 2020 with the number of dollars being given out was $705 million. This was because of COVID, there was a significant decrease in students enrolling in higher education programs because of the pandemic. We start to see an upward trend in 2021 with the amount of dollars being given out totaling at $711 million dollars and the trend continuing upwards after 2023. We hope to see the number continuing as we get further away from the pandemic. </p>

			<p>The chart “TAP recipient Total By Academic Year” shows that while the recipient headcount had been on a gradual, term decline since a peak in the mid-2000s, the rate of decline accelerated significantly starting in 2020. In 2019, the total number of TAP recipients was approximately 300,000. Over the next two years, the headcount fell to a low of approximately 240,000 recipients in both 2021 and 2022. This represents a 20% drop of a two-year period. While there was a slight bounce back in 2023 with approximately 255,000 recipients in 2023, the total still remains under the pre-pandemic levels.</p>

			<p>According to the National Student Clearinghouse there is a “strong resurgence at community colleges, which are seeing enrollment climb 4.0%, more than double the growth seen at public four-year institutions (+1.9%) and substantially higher than at private nonprofit four-year colleges (+0.9%)”. This general increase in enrollment shows that community colleges are becoming alluring options for students that are seeking flexible, affordable, and career-oriented education pathways. With the rise in community college enrollment, these institutions might see an increase in financial aid enrollment. Based on my data findings, there is a significant difference in TAP recipients yearly from private to public schools, with more public school students requesting aid.</p>

			<h3>Did the pandemic really affect New York's Financial Aid?</h3>
			<p>The data supports the conclusion that COVID pandemic created a rapid and severe decline in demand for financial aid across New York State. The decline began in 2020 and clearly establishes the pandemic as a major shock to the system. The total TAP dollars distributed fell by approximately $140 million, with a corresponding loss of about 60,000 students receiving financial aid between 2019 and 2022. This shows a significant decline in seeking higher education from certain demographics that were not reported on in my initial data. With a slight rebound in 2023, the financial aid landscape remains fundamentally weaker and smaller than its pre-pandemic state. While the reasoning for the decline may not be clear, this data and graphs serve as a clear indicator of the pandemic's lasting negative impact on access, enrollments, and critical financial support systems in higher education institutions. </p>
